## Overview

This is codeflower, an app for visualizing git repositories. If you give it a repo, it generates a force directed graph that allows you to see the overall file structure of the repo, as well as the languages used and the number of lines of code in each language.

You can access the app in two ways:

1. by heading to [codeflower.la](https://codeflower.la), and entering the git clone url of the repo you want to visualize.

2. by installing the app as an extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codeflower/mnlengnbfpfgcfdgfpkjekoaeophmmeh) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codeflower/). Once it's installed, navigate to the github page of the repo you want to visualize and click the "Codeflower" tab.
