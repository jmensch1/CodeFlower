Visualize repos on github.

The extension adds a "Codeflower" tab to the navigation bar on github.com. When you click on the tab, you'll see the repository, visualized as a d3 force-directed graph.

The inner nodes in the graph correspond to the directories in the repository, and the outer (colored) nodes correspond to the files. The size of the outer nodes increases with the number of lines of code in the file, and the color of the outer nodes indicates what language the file is written in.
